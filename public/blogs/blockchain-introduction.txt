Blockchain is a distributed ledger technology that allows data to be securely stored across a network of computers. Each block in the blockchain contains a list of transactions, and these blocks are linked together in chronological order.

One of blockchain's key features is its immutability. Once data is recorded in a block, it cannot be altered without changing all subsequent blocks. This ensures data integrity and security.

Blockchain technology has gained widespread recognition for its role in powering cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, its applications extend beyond finance. Blockchain is used in supply chain management, healthcare, voting systems, and more.

Smart contracts, another feature of blockchain, enable self-executing agreements without the need for intermediaries. This has opened up new possibilities for decentralized applications (DApps).

Despite its benefits, blockchain faces challenges such as scalability, energy consumption, and regulatory concerns. Nevertheless, its potential to revolutionize industries continues to drive innovation and adoption.
