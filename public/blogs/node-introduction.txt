Node.js is a runtime environment that allows developers to execute JavaScript code outside the browser. Built on Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, Node.js enables developers to build fast and scalable network applications.

At its core, Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which makes it lightweight and efficient. This design is particularly suited for data-intensive real-time applications, such as chat servers and streaming platforms.

Node.js offers a rich ecosystem of libraries and tools through its package manager, npm. Developers can leverage these modules to build server-side applications, APIs, command-line tools, and more.

One of Node.js's key features is its single-threaded nature. While it uses a single thread for the main event loop, it can handle multiple I/O operations concurrently by delegating them to worker threads. This makes Node.js highly efficient for handling simultaneous requests.

Overall, Node.js has revolutionized back-end development by enabling JavaScript to be used as a full-stack language. Its versatility, performance, and active community make it a valuable tool for modern software development.
