Git is a version control system that allows developers to track changes to their codebase, collaborate effectively, and manage project versions. GitHub is a platform built on Git that provides additional tools for collaboration, code hosting, and project management.

With Git, developers can create repositories to organize their code. They can commit changes to track progress, create branches to experiment with new features, and merge branches to integrate features into the main project. Git's distributed nature allows each developer to have a full copy of the repository, ensuring redundancy and flexibility.

GitHub enhances Git's capabilities by offering an online platform to host repositories. It provides features like pull requests, where team members can review and discuss changes before merging them. GitHub Actions allow developers to automate workflows, such as running tests or deploying applications.

Together, Git and GitHub have become essential tools for modern software development, fostering collaboration, transparency, and efficiency in projects of all sizes.
